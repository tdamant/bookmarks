As someone who browses the web
So that I can easily access my favourite websites
I'd like to see these websites as a list of bookmarks

# Set up Postgres DB
Connect to psql
Create the database using the psql command CREATE DATABASE bookmark_manager;
Connect to the database using the pqsl command \c bookmark_manager;
Run the query we have saved in the file 01_create_bookmarks_table.sql
